This work is a final graduation's project from Ricardo Müller.
Ricardo Müller is a computer scientist, graduated in the UFFS - Chapecó, in 12/2019.
This projects uses the huge mobile data from Geolife project, that belongs to the Microsoft and is written in a article by Zheng, Chen in 2008 and 2010.
Written in python and sklearn, it pretends to develop a study about machine learning, using two decision algorithms (Decision tree and Random Forest) and three model selection (Kfold, Train Test Split and Stratified Kfold)

In the beggining, this project transforms the mobile data in routes, that will be learned by the algorithms, that will classify the data in 4 classes: bike, bus, car or walk.
